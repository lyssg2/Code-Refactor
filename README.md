# Code-Refractor

The motivation of this project was to refract a website for a marketing agency that has a codebase in which to follow accessibility standards
so that their website is optimized for search engines.

Upon doing so, I rewrote the documents to include semantic HTML, reorganized attributes and elements to make it more user-friendly, and 
cleaned/combined elements to appear more concise and suitable for future use.

Alt Language was added to all images to meet accessibility standards.
